|LOINC codes|Storage|<p>Where can you find these codes ?</p><p></p>|<https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/kmehr/en/page/retam-exports>|
|Issues|eHealth|To whom can you address our questions and issues ?|<p>The created github from eHealth is the place to ask questions or to signal a problem:</p><p><https://github.com/hl7-be/lab/issues></p><p></p>|

|GP software solution|Finding results of medical examinations|How can a GP know the correct reference values in case of multiple tests ?|<p>The GP can refer to the message. He can use a LOINC code. It’s up to each software vendor to foresee a solution by using graphs, stats …</p><p>This subject will be treated by the hubs and a document will be published after analysis containing the parameters that can be used to question the hub-metahub system.</p><p></p>|
|Use cases|Definition|What is use case ?|<p>This term finds its origin in UML (Unified Modeling Language), the theoretical definition says: it’s a description of a behavior of a system that reacts on an input from the outside world.</p><p>On a practical level you need to test a new application and therefore you need a set of real situations in input to be able to test your system and to control the validity of the outcome. The number and the quality of the use cases will determine the risk percentage on errors of your application.</p><p></p>|
