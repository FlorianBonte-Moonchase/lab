# Test Plan

This document lists cases to be tested for Laboratory Results in FHIR Format.   Most cases apply to the Visualisation Tools, but not all of them.

Work in progress; following may not be complete:

* References to (Macsys) test protocols and example FHIR files
* Last chapters still need to be written out
* Per test case, the exact acceptance criteria need to be added to the document
* To detail per case, whether the case is relevant to the visualisation tool or not (some cases are only relevant to GP software or hospital systems).  Cases are flagged when not relevant to visualiser
* There are no references yet to MIPS test protocols and example FHIR files

  

## 1.	Structure & agreements

1A: Results on different levels in hierarchy; panels and “titles” on different sublevels.  Including very complex structures (fruit & food allergies).

1C: BundleId and DiagnosticReportId conform to Belgian HL7 standards
* Test files:
  *  (need a set that has different versions of the protocol)
* Acceptance criteria:

8B: Multiple Annexes in (potentially) multiple formats

**This case is not covered by Macsys examples; in the case of "multiple annexes", Macsys includes those as different pages in one embedded pdf document, i.e. one "embedded annex" in the FHIR message.  Senders other than Macsys may provide examples for this case.


## 9.	Microbiology

TBD

## 10.	Anapath

10A: Protocol with Pathology + Clinical Biology
* Test files:
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/Macsys/815333059
* Acceptance criteria
  * Receiver treats both pathology and clinical biology as per relevant pdf version of the protocol

10B: Single pathology protocol
* Test files:
  * https://github.com/hl7-be/hl7-be-fhir-laboratory-report/tree/master/testing/Macsys/815333060

## 11.	Protocols in different languages

TBD

## 12. Joint example from multiple labs for same subject

**This whole section is not relevant for/not tested by visualisation tool**

12A: CMA+AKL

Case is as follows: AKL and CMA are 2 differen labs/RIZIV numbers). But they use the same analysis encoding, methodolgies, reference ranges etc.  Results from both labs can safely be plotted cumulatively.

12B:  iLab and MIPS

Case is as follows: MIPS and iLabs are never used at the same time by the same lab.   Whether analyses may be plotted cumulatively depends on LOINC encoding, units etc.

## 13. Stress Testing

For this chapter we provide xamples of extreme protocols, either with extreme number of analyses, or extremely large annexes.  Functionally, the examples below do not add any additional functionality to be tested (i.e. all cases in these protocols are tested in earlier test steps; here we are merely testinng volumes and complexity).

* Test files:
  * Macsys FIDLAB example: TBD 
* Acceptance criterium
  *  Receiving system manages the process the FHIR messages (no memory or timing issues)

## 14. Transmission via eHealthbox

* Test files:
  * Any FHIR message can be used
* Acceptance criteria:
  * Message successfully leaves sender system
  * Message successfully arrives @ receiver system
  * Message received equals message sent
